This is test task for some job



Required libs at requirement.txt


How it work
run - scrapy crawl example -o result.csv
replace if needed result.csv into /spiders dir
run - scrapy crawl exampledownload -o downloadresult.csv


I also added this https://github.com/WiliTest/Anonymous-scrapping-Scrapy-Tor-Privoxy-UserAgent
to avoid ban from e27.co


Need to improve:
last pagination page error
.os code to avoid situation with result.csv replacement
